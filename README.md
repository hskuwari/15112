<p>I will be making a mobile app game that is similar to Subway Surfers. It is a game where there will be a person running trying to avoid all obstacles and avoiding it is by flicking right or left or jumping by flicking up (touch screen).  </p>
<p>I will use one library to create the game: kivy. Kivy is a library where it is able to transfer the game to a mobile app and adding touch screen, etc.  One of the main features is that it will use a touch screen to play it. Moreover, I would like to add coins where it would add to the score. The user loses when they collect black coins which will make them lose. </p>
<p>The user interface would be a simple 2D game. It would look like a classic vintage game. In a way, it would be portrait view so it would not be sideways but it would be front view. By that, I mean the player would see the character’s back and the road in front of the character as well as coins.</p>
<p>Hopefully by November 13th, I would have the chara running and jumping. If possible, I will add the coins.</p>
