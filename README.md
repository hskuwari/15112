<p>For this checkpoint, I only have the character running and jumping in every position. I also tried to do coins animation in another python file. However, It can only do animation for one position. I'm planning to merge both codes together and add the score and black coins.</p>
<p>All the pictures in this branch are used in one or both files.</p>
